# NIST Vulnerability Data Ontology

 The Vulntology is a project created to characterize vulnerabilities and provide a granular and intuitive structure for that information. This repository is a location to support community development of the NIST Vulnerability Data Ontology, or Vulntology.


#### Goals

- To standardize the description of vulnerabilities through structured characterization formatting. <br />
- To enable automated scoring agnostic of any particular system.<br />
- To improve the level of detail in provided information for the purpose of assisting with defense while minimizing increased risk from attacks.<br />
- To allow for easier vulnerability information sharing across language barriers<br />


#### Resources Inside
There are [Introduction](specification/introduction/) materials available for a general overview of the Vulntology. For those already familiar you can look into the [Figures](specification/figures/), [Objects](specification/objects/) and/or [Values](specification/values/) sections. 

#### How to Help
We are currently looking for assistance from organizations and people within the vulnerability management community. For those interested please ***instructions for joining and working***
