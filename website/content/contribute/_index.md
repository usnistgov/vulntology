# Welcome to the Vulntology Community

We are excited that you want to contribute to the Metaschema project. We are striving to provide a collaborative environment for professionals and hobbyists alike to contribute to the project's goals and objectives.

## Contributing

We use GitHub as a collaboration platform for the development of the Metaschema framework. Within the project's GitHub repository you will find:

- A [set of issues](https://github.com/usnistgov/vulntology/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue) for which we need your help. Feel free to pick from this list, or [reach out to us](#contact-us) about any other ideas you might have.
- [Guidelines](https://github.com/usnistgov/vulntology/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) on contributing to this project.
- A [project board](https://github.com/usnistgov/vulntology/projects) that shows the issues the team is currently working on.

## Contact Us

Please email the [project team](mailto:vulntology@nist.gov) with any questions you have about this project or if you are interested in getting involved.

A [Gitter chat room](https://matrix.to/#/#vulntology_community:gitter.im) is available for Metaschema discussions. This is a great place to discuss issues with the NIST developers and ask for assistance with building Metaschema-enabled tools. This room is also setup with GitHub integration, which provides a good summary of recent Metaschema GitHub repo activities within the chat room.
