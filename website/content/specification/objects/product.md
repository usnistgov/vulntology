# Product Object

The software and/or hardware configurations that are known to be vulnerable to exploitation of the vulnerability [Scenario](../scenario).  Different Product configurations can be associated with different Scenarios to allow for description of varying impacts and exploitation mechanisms. 

## Properties

This is intended to be used for simple enumerations such as generic free text or common formats that identify explicit instances of products such as CPE or SWID.
- **hasNvdCpeApplicabilityStatement** (one): This is to reference the NVD configurations section, which requires much more complex JSON than simple strings.
- **hasCve5Product** (one): This is to reference the CVE Program CVE 5 JSON's product section, which can communicate many complicated methods of string based product applicability.
