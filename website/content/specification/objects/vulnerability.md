# Vulnerability Object

A Vulnerability is any weakness in the computational logic found in products or devices that could be exploited by a threat source [NISTIR 7298](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/ir/7298/r3/final). 

## Semantics

A *vulnerability* affects a set of *originating products* and is described by a set of distinct exploitation [*scenarios*](../scenario). An *originating product* may be or contain the vulnerable product.

Each *scenario* is related to a set of *affected products*, which may be a subset of the *originating products* or may represent a product that depends on the *originating product*.

## Properties

A *vulnerability* has the following properties.

### Sector Of Interest

{{%usa-tag%}}Name{{%/usa-tag%}} `hasSectorOfInterest`
{{%usa-tag%}}Cardinality{{%/usa-tag%}} zero or many
{{%usa-tag%}}Description{{%/usa-tag%}} Supplemental information identifying potential sectors or use cases where the *vulnerability* could have an impact.

The value of `hasSectorOfInterest` MUST be a value from the [sector of interest value list](../../values/context).

## Relationships

A *vulnerability* has the following relationships.

### Known Chain

{{%usa-tag%}}Name{{%/usa-tag%}} `hasKnownChain`
{{%usa-tag%}}Cardinality{{%/usa-tag%}} zero or many
{{%usa-tag%}}Description{{%/usa-tag%}} Identifies other known *vulnerabilities* that can be used in conjunction with the *vulnerability* in question to achieve a different and likely greater impact.

The object value of the `hasKnownChain` relationship MUST be a [vulnerability identifier](../vulnerability-identifier) object.

### Identity

{{%usa-tag%}}Name{{%/usa-tag%}} `hasIdentity`
{{%usa-tag%}}Cardinality{{%/usa-tag%}} one or many
{{%usa-tag%}}Description{{%/usa-tag%}} Indicates an alternate string used to identify the *vulnerability*.

The object value of the `hasIdentity` relationship MUST be a [vulnerability identifier](../vulnerability-identifier) object.

### Scenario

{{%usa-tag%}}Name{{%/usa-tag%}} `hasScenario`
{{%usa-tag%}}Cardinality{{%/usa-tag%}} one or many
{{%usa-tag%}}Description{{%/usa-tag%}} Lists the [*scenarios*](../scenario) associated with the *vulnerability*.

The object value of the `hasScenario` relationship MUST be a [*scenario*](../scenario) object.

### Originating Product

{{%usa-tag%}}Name{{%/usa-tag%}} `hasOriginatingProduct`
{{%usa-tag%}}Cardinality{{%/usa-tag%}} one or many
{{%usa-tag%}}Description{{%/usa-tag%}} [Product](../product) shall be associated with Vulnerability

The object value of the `hasOriginatingProduct` relationship MUST be a [*product*](../product) object.

## Example
```json
{
 "Vulnerability": {
  "hasIdentity": [
    {
     "scheme": "http://cve.mitre.org",
     "value": "CVE-2050-1234"
    }
  ],
  "hasSectorOfInterest": [
   "Industrial Control System",
   "Health Care"
   ],
  "hasOriginatingProduct": {
   "hasEnumeration": [
    {
     "scheme": "https://csrc.nist.gov/ns/cpe/2.3",
     "values": [
      "cpe:2.3:a:fake:fakeproductX:1.0.0",
      "cpe:2.3:a:fake:fakeproductY:1.0.0"
     ]
    },
    {
     "scheme": "https://nist.gov/cpe/2.2",
     "values": ["cpe:/a:fake"]
    }
   ],
  },
  "hasScenario": [
   ]
 }
}
```
