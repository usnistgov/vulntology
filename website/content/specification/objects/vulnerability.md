# Vulnerability Object

A Vulnerability is any weakness in the computational logic found in products or devices that could be exploited by a threat source.

## Semantics

A *vulnerability* affects a set of *originating products* and is described by a set of distinct exploitation [*scenarios*](../scenario). An *originating product* may be or contain the vulnerable product.

Each *scenario* is related to a set of *affected products*, which may be a subset of the *originating products* or may represent a product used by an *originating product*.

## Properties

A *vulnerability* has the following properties.

### Sector Of Interest

{{%usa-tag%}}Name{{%/usa-tag%}} `hasSectorOfInterest`
{{%usa-tag%}}Cardinality{{%/usa-tag%}} zero or many
{{%usa-tag%}}Description{{%/usa-tag%}} Supplemental information identifying potential sectors or use cases where the Vulnerability could have an impact. (See [Sector of Interest](../../values/sector-of-interest))

## Relationships

A *vulnerability* has the following relationships.
