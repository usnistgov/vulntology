# Vulnerability Object

A Vulnerability is any weakness in the computational logic found in products or devices that could be exploited by a threat source.

## Semantics

A *vulnerability* affects a set of *originating products* and is described by a set of distinct exploitation [*scenarios*](../scenario). An *originating product* may be or contain the vulnerable product.

Each *scenario* is related to a set of *affected products*, which may be a subset of the *originating products* or may represent a product used by an *originating product*.

## Properties

A *vulnerability* has the following properties.

### Sector Of Interest

{{%usa-tag%}}Name{{%/usa-tag%}} `hasSectorOfInterest`
{{%usa-tag%}}Cardinality{{%/usa-tag%}} zero or many
{{%usa-tag%}}Description{{%/usa-tag%}} Supplemental information identifying potential sectors or use cases where the *vulnerability* could have an impact.

The value of `hasSectorOfInterest` MUST be a value from the [sector of interest value list](../../values/context).

## Relationships

A *vulnerability* has the following relationships.

### Known Chain

{{%usa-tag%}}Name{{%/usa-tag%}} `hasKnownChain`
{{%usa-tag%}}Cardinality{{%/usa-tag%}} zero or many
{{%usa-tag%}}Description{{%/usa-tag%}} Identifies other known *vulnerabilities* that can be used in conjunction with the *vulnerability* in question to achieve a different and likely greater impact.

The object value of the `hasKnownChain` relationship MUST be a [vulnerability identifier](../vulnerability-identifier) object.

### Identity

{{%usa-tag%}}Name{{%/usa-tag%}} `hasIdentity`
{{%usa-tag%}}Cardinality{{%/usa-tag%}} one or many
{{%usa-tag%}}Description{{%/usa-tag%}} Indicates an alternate string used to identify the *vulnerability*.

The object value of the `hasIdentity` relationship MUST be a [vulnerability identifier](../vulnerability-identifier) object.

### Scenario

{{%usa-tag%}}Name{{%/usa-tag%}} `hasScenario`
{{%usa-tag%}}Cardinality{{%/usa-tag%}} one or many
{{%usa-tag%}}Description{{%/usa-tag%}} Lists the [*scenarios*](../scenario) associated with the *vulnerability*.

The object value of the `hasScenario` relationship MUST be a [*scenario*](../scenario) object.

### Originating Product

{{%usa-tag%}}Name{{%/usa-tag%}} `hasOriginatingProduct`
{{%usa-tag%}}Cardinality{{%/usa-tag%}} one or many
{{%usa-tag%}}Description{{%/usa-tag%}} [Product](../product) shall be associated with Vulnerability

The object value of the `hasOriginatingProduct` relationship MUST be a [*product*](../product) object.
