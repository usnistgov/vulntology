# Criticality Values

A measure of the relative importance of the associated Scope. This noun group is only relevant when the Scope has a value of 'Limited'. When Scope is 'Limited', Criticality must be used in order to provide additional information about its importance. Criticality must be considered in concert with the Context to which it is associated. That is, for a given Context (such as Guest OS or Application), the Criticality should reflect how significant an associated impact could be for the specific Context. An impact in a 'Guest OS' Context may be of lower significance than the same impact in a 'Host OS' Context and should be reflected accordingly by its associated Criticality.

## Values

- **High**:  The impact relatively significant
- **Low**:  The impact is relatively insignificant
